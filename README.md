https://devpost.com/software/stickyboard

A Hackathon project  built in 2015 for [Meteor Global distributed hackathon](https://meteor-2015.devpost.com/).

**Inspiration** <br>
Windows default sticky notes, Trello

**What it does** <br>
- Creates window's kind of sticky notes on the internet with Beautiful colors.
- No signin/signup, just create/remember the unique board name.
- Access it from anywhere, directly with board name.
- sticky.meteor.com/yourUniqueBoardNameHere
- Move notes anywhere in the whole screen in real time. complete screen is droppable area.
- Unsecure but highly secure if board name is smart and longer :)
- Some restrictions applied(No more than 10 notes on home page & no more than 50 notes on board for now)

**How I built it** <br>
- By writing in coffeeScript without any coffee or caffeine :)
- Host OS - windows 8.1
- Guest OS - Xubuntu on vBox
- Text editor - Sublime Text 3
- And Google Chrome

**Challenges I ran into** <br>
- Finding idea was a biggest challenge.
- Dragging and dropping elements.
- Content editable div issue on meteor.
- Poor internet, so deploying was slow :)

**Accomplishments that I'm proud of** <br>
- Writing this markup at 5:05 AM.
- 16 Hour of continue coding.
- Build sticky with in a day.

**What I learned** <br>
- Don't spent time in setting up the app from scratch, create a meteor boilerplate and get ready with it next time.
- How to drag n drop element and update it's absolute position in realtime.
